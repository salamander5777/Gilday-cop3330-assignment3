This program reads `exercise46_input.txt` and counts the frequency of words in the file, then outputs in histogram
format.

Creation of a static int variable called 'word_length' which tracks the length of the longest word.
function histogramPrint(Map<String, Integer> sortedWordFrequency){

    Creation of a for loop that goes through the entrySet() of the Map.
        Prints out the current getKey(), which is the word, formatted to the longest word +2.
        Creation of an internal for loop where a variable 'i' is 0 and being incremented by 1 per loop up to the
        getValue() set to the current key.
            prints out 1 '*' per loop.

end
}

function main(){

    Creation of a new Map<String, Integer> which will be use each unique word as a key and the value being the
    amount of times the word appeared.
    Creation of the instance for text reading, and then creating a scanner that will read through it later.

    Creation of a while loop that will loop until there are no new lines in the input text.
        Creation of a string that will scan in each individual word. If the word is equal to a key already in the
        Map then it will not be added, but the frequencyCount for the particular word will be incremented by one.
        If the word is not equal to a key already in the Map then it will be set to a new key and the
        frequencyCount value set to the word will be one.

    Creation of a new TreeMap equal to the current Map created above. The new sorted Map is then used in the
    function call histogramPrint(sortedWordFrequency);
