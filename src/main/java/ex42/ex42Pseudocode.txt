This program reads in a list from a file called `exercise42_input.txt` and prints it out in a tabular format.

Creation of a static int variable called 'entry_amount' which tracks the amount of lines there are.
function ArrayList<String> reader(){

    Creation of the instance for text reading, and then creating a scanner that will read through it later.
    Creation of an ArrayList that will later hold the names and salary found in the text file.

    Use of a while loop to add the information of each line into the arraylist.
        Creation of a String[] that holds information of each line, separating information through .split(",").
        Adding each spot of String[] to the array, and then incrementing 'entry_amount' by 3.

    return arraylist.
end
}

function main(){

    Using a while loop until an int variable,  incremented by three per loop, is equal to 'entry_amount'.
        Call 'reader()' in a format print function to properly print the information in tabular fashion.
