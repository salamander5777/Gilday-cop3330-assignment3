This program takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that product.

function boolean productSearch(String product_name){

    Use 'try' for JsonReader of FileReader("src/main/java/ex44/exercise44_input.json")
        Begin reading object, then name, then array.

        Creation of a while loop that will loop until the input file has nothing new.
            Begin reading of next object then create another while loop that will loop until nothing new.
                Read in 'nextName()'. If 'nextName()' is equal to 'name', 'price', or 'quantity' then set the
                'nextString()' equal to their respective variables.
            End reading object.

            If Objects.equals(product_name, name) is true then print "Name: " + name + "\nPrice: " + price +
            "\nQuantity " + quantity.
                return false, which will exit the current function.

    If the function did not exit above then print out that the product was not found.
    return true, which will exit the current function.

end
}

function main(){

    Creation of a do while that will loop as long as productSearch(product_name) is true (This will call the
    function).
        The inside of the while loop will print the prompt "What is the product name? ", and then takes in
        user input.
