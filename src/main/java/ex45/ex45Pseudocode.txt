This program reads 'exercise45_input.txt' and replaces all instances of the word 'utilize' with the word 'use'.

Creation of a static int variable called 'line_count' which tracks the amount of lines in the text file.

function ArrayList<String> reader(){

    Creation of the instance for text reading, and then creating a scanner that will read through it later.
    Creation of an ArrayList that will later hold the information of 'exercise45_input.txt'

    Creation of a while loop that will loop until there are no more new lines. (Increment line_count each loop).
        Creation of a string that will hold in the scanned line.
        Creation of a string that will be equal to the string above, but with replaceAll("utilize","use").

    return ArrayList.
end
}

function main(){

    Creation of the prompt "What do you want the output file to be named? ". If the text file already exist
    in the current project folder then it will be deleted, otherwise it will be created.

    Call the function 'reader()', then use a for loop of a variable incrementing by 1 per loop until it reaches
    the value of 'line_count'.
        Write to the new text file the information returned by 'reader()'.
